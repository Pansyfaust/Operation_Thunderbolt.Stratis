/*
    akp: just read the mine classes from the config
    akp: it should take a position
    akp: and radius
    akp: dont find the position, that's the job of map functions
    akp: old thunderbolt already had mines placed in front of player movement and a chance to surround the objective
    akp: you could look at the old function, it's mostly ok i think
    akp: mines just need to be in a circle spot or doughnut (to protect a target)
    akp: rectangular, or hollow box minefields are ok too, but can be added later

    return the mines in an array (we'll probably need to delete them after a while)
